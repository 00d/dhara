# Campaign Rules

<h2>Character Creation &amp; Advancement</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Ability scores are generated by dice pool:<br />
	Each character has a pool of 24d6 to assign to their statistics. Before the dice are rolled, the player selects the number of dice to roll for each score, with a minimum of 3d6 for each ability. Once the dice have been assigned, the player rolls each group and totals the result of the three highest dice.</li>
	<li>Every character has two Traits plus any number of additional Traits, up to the normal limit of one per <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/traits/">type of Trait</a>. For each additional Trait, the player must choose a Drawback.</li>
	<li>Player characters begin the campaign at level 1 and follow <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/character-advancement/">medium advancement</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Skills</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Artistry and Lore, both of which are available to all classes as class skills.</li>
	<li>Appraise is banned. All checks to appraise an items value can be made using a relevant Artistry, Craft, or Profession check. Profession (merchant) is often applicable, while the Knowledge or Lore skills may assist with rare or historically significant items.</li>
	<li>Craft will use the alternate system presented under &quot;Making Craft Work&quot; under the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/craft">Alternative Crafting Rules</a>. Arts-related Crafts such as painting and sculpture are instead the purview of the Artistry skill.</li>
	<li>Sleight of Hand &ndash; You may attempt feint checks using Sleight of Hand instead of Bluff.</li>
	<li>Stealth &ndash; When multiple characters attempt Stealth checks collectively, as a group, all characters roll their Stealth checks normally, then take the average of the results (sum all the results and divide by the number of characters, rounding down). That is the result for all characters participating.</li>
</ul>
